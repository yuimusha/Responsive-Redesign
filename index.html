            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. An existing interface was analyzed and was redesigned to improve the usability and accessibility. The sketch of the redeisgn, low-fidelty wireframes, high-fidelty mockups, and the final redesigned website is included in this webpage.</p>

                    <p>This is a website of a Japanese restaurant located in Providence, serving as a platform to offer an introduction to the restaurant while also presenting the menu and contact details for user convenience. I chose this website to redesign because the website seemed outdated and it was evident that redesigning it would significantly improve its user-friendliness.</p>

                    <p>The accessibility of the website was analyzed using WebAIM WAVE. Using WebAim WAVE, 2 errors and 37 alerts were given for this webpage. The 2 errors (spacing image missing alternative text, language missing or invalid) are in the coding of the webpage, and while the error is not visible on the webpage, it should be fixed. Furthermore, of the 37 alerts, 29 were due to small text size, which I agree with. The text size in the menu bar should be increased to higher readability. In addition, 2 of the alerts were due to redundant links to the home page. I think that the home page link in the menu bar could still be kept, but additional features like an underline could be added to the link name to indicate that the user is currently on that page. Other alerts included “no heading structure”, “no page regions”, and “layout tables”. These alerts are due to the way the webpage was coded, and should be fixed when redesigning the webpage.</p>
